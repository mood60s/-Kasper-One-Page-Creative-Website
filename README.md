# Kasper â€“ One Page Creative Website

Kasper is a sleek and modern one-page website I designed and developed, ideal for portfolios, agencies, or creative businesses. It features a clean layout, responsive design, smooth scrolling, and carefully structured sections for showcasing content effectively. Built with semantic HTML, CSS, and optionally JavaScript, Kasper highlights simplicity, performance, and user-focused design.

Feel free to explore, learn, or use it as a starting point for your own web projects.
